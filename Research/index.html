    <h1> Current Research </h1>
    
    <p> I currently work with the <a href="http://www.bdnyc.org">BDNYC</a> Research group, where I am adivsed by Dr. Jackie Faherty on a variety of projects related to brown dwarfs and low-mass stars.
   
    <h2>Determing Fundamental Parameters of Brown Dwarfs and low-mass stars via SED fitting</h2>
    <h3>Understanding subdwarfs via a case study of SDSS J125637.13-022452.4</h3>
    <p>Over the past year and half I have been working on understanding atmospheric featurs of brown dwarfs though a detailed study of the subdwarf SDSS J1256-0224.
    Subdwarfs are low-metallicity objects that are halo members. They are unusally blue NIR colors and are thought to be likely cloudless.
    In this project I used distance-calibrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to compare SDSS J1256-0224 to objects of the same temperature and bolometic luminosity
    In doing so we found that clouds help change the overall SED shape, while gravity and metallicity features dominate the varations seen in the NIR bands.
    We also compared SDSS J1256 to subdwarfs with parallaxes and found that tempertaure does not correlate linearly with spectral type. 
    Finally we compared fundamental parameters of the subdwarf population as a whole to low-gravity and field sources and determined polynomial fits.
    To read more about this project check out our recent publication on the <a href="https://arxiv.org/pdf/1807.04794.pdf">arXiv</a>. </p>
    
    <h3>Is Trappist-1 a unique host star?</h3>
    <p>My latest work is on determing if Trappist-1 is a unique M-dwarf host star. Since Trappist-1 hoest seven rocky planets, woth four in it's habitable zone
    we hope to understand how common this type of system is. Trappist-1 is currently though to be an older object, with an age of ~7.6 Gyr, however
    it recieves and INT-G classification when using the Allers & Liu 2013 indices. In this project we are comparing Trappist-1 to a sample
    of objects of the same temperature, bolometric luminosity, or gravity classification in an effort to understand the age of this fascinating system.</p>
   
    <h2>Atmopsheric Retrievals</h2>
    <p>For the bulk of my thesis work I will be moving over to theory with atmospheric reteivals of brown dwarfs. Retrievals are a modeling
    techniuqe that starts with a spectrum of an objects and pulls out a Pressure-Temperature profile of the object. Along with that
    profile, we retieve elemental and molecular abunadances in the atmosphere of the source. All of this can then be used to generate
    a syntheic spectrum and to determine fundamental properties. I am currently working the the <p font-style:'italic';>Brewster</p> 
    code written by Dr. Ben Burningham. We are planning for the retrieval SDSS J1256-0224 as the first source in my study.</p>
    
    
    <h2>My SRMP Students Projects</h2>
    <p>I also mentor high school students through the Science Research Mentoring Program (<a href="http://www.srmp4life.com/">SRMP</a>)
    the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). This program consits of a year-long internship for high school students to work
    with a researcher at the musuem on a project related to their work. Students also attened monthly advisories where they develop
    other skills to be sucessful in research and their future careers.</p>
   
    <h3>SRMP 2018-2019</h3>
    <p>This year the students will be working on creating updated SEDs for field objects in the Filipazzo et al. 2015 sample
    using new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and medium-resolution NIR spectra. With these updated SEDs we can improve values for field 
    dwarf fundamental parameters. They will also learn how to use the ,a href="http://database.bdnyc.org/query'>BDNYC Database</a>,
    a large database of brown dwarfs containing paralaxes, spectra, photometry and more. </p>

    <h3>SRMP 2017-2018: Stellar Speeds for Not So Stellar Objects</h3>
    <p>The students this year spent their time examing newly discovered brown dwarfs via a proper motion search. The group
    created proper motion diagrams and spectral typed a small sample of objects in order to understand why these objects may
    have been missed in previous studies.</p>
    
     <h1> Past Research </h1>
     <h3>Testing the Refurbished Leuschner 30-inch Telescope and it exoplanet detection capabilites</h3>
     <p>For my master's thesis work at San Francisco State University, I worked with Dr. Adrienne Cool on a project that was part
     telecope testing and part research. I spent half of my time testing the pointing, tracking, and focusing ablities of the 
     then recently refurbished Lesuchner 30-inch Telescope, located outside of Lafayette, CA. The other half of my time seeing 
     if Leuschner telescope could be used to detect transiting exoplanets. We in fact were able to detect transits of bright 
     known hot Jupiters. </p>
    
     <h3>Blazhko Effect in RR Lyrae Stars</h3>
     <p>For my undergraduate Senior thesis at Michigan State, I worked with Dr. Horace Smith on determining light curves and
    periods for three stars. The goal of the project was to look for the Blazhko effect in the lightcurve of these RR Lyrae 
    stars and to build data for the relationship between the shape of the lightcurve and the metallicity in the SLOAN filters.</p>

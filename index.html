			I am Dr. Eileen Gonzales, an Assitant Professor at <a href="https://physics.sfsu.edu/"> San Franciso State University in the Department of Physics & Astronomy</a>. My research focuses on understanding the fundamental parameters and atmospheres of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs, and directly-imaged exoplanets through observational and theoretical-based techniques. Using atmospheric retrievals, my current work aims to understand cloud properties as well as key chemical processes shaping the formation and evolution of directly-imaged exoplanets and low-gravity brown dwarfs. 
				Prior to coming to SF State, I was a <a href="https://www.hsfoundation.org/programs/science/51-pegasi-b-fellowship/"> 51 Pegasi b</a> Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University in the <a href="https://astro.cornell.edu/"> Department of Astronomy</a>. I received my PhD at the City University of New York Graduate Center in New York City, where I worked in the Brown Dwarfs in New York City (<a href="http://www.bdnyc.org/">BDNYC</a>) research group. 
				I am a co-founder and director of <a href="https://blackinphysics.org/"> Black In Physics</a> a non-profit organization dedicated to not only celebrating Black physicists and our contributions but also to reveal a more complete picture of what a physicist looks like. I also am a lead organizer of #BlackInPhysics Week on <a href="https://twitter.com/BlackinPhysics">Twitter</a>, the largest event of the year for Black In Physics.  
				I am a former <a href="https://astrodatascience.org/"> LSSTC Data Science Fellow </a>, a former Research Mentor in the <a href="https://www.srmp4life.com">Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP)</a> at the American Museum of Natural History, and a former mentor in the <a href="https://gradschool.cornell.edu/diversity-inclusion/student-organizations/multicultural-academic-council-mentoring-program/"> Cornell MAC Mentoring Program</a>.

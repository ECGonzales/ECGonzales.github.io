		<p class="clear"> I grew up in Virginia Beach, VA and have traveled across the country and back for my degrees.<p>

		<p>I recieved my BS in Astrophysics from Michigan State University and then went on to get my MS in Physics, 
		concentration in Astronomy from San Francisco State University. Currently, I am a PhD candidate at the City 
		University of New York (CUNY) Graduate Center in New York City and am part of the Brown Dwarfs in New York City 
		Research Group (BDNYC). As a PhD at CUNY I have also earned my MA (Hunter College) and MPhil (Graduate Center) 
		in Physics, completing the Master's degree trifecta. My research focuses on understanding atmsopheres of brown dwarfs 
		and low-mass stars via distance-calibrated spectral energy distributions and atmospheric retrievals. </br></p>

		<p>Fun former job facts include: Teaching kids engineering with legos as an Instructor at Playwell TEKnologies, 
		teaching summer camp science courses for 3rd-5th graders with Camp Galieo, and working at Impression 5 Science 
		center teaching a wide variety of workshops to school groups, the general public and for birthday parties.</br></p>

		<p>When I'm not doing science, I enjoy lindy hop, running, and getting up to random adventures with friends.</p>

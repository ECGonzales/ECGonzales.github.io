		<p class="clear"> I'm from Virgina Beach,VA but nobody ever knows where I'm from based on all of my cross-country 
		travels for my degrees.<p>

		<p>I recieved my BS in Astrophysics from Michigan State and then went on to get my MS in Physics, 
		concentration in Astronomy from San Francisco State. Im a currenty a PhD student at the CUNY Graduate Center
		and I spend my time working at the American Museum on Natural History with the BDNYC Research group. I study 
		atmospheric properties of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. </br></p>

		<p>Som fun facts about some of my past jobs include: getting paid to teach kids how to build with legos through
		Playwell TEKnologies, teaching summer camp science courses with Camp Galieo, and working at Impression 5 Science
		center teaching a wide variety of workshops to school groups, the general public and birthday parties.</br></p>

		<p>When I'm not doing science, I enjoy lindy hop, running, and getting up to random adventures with friends.</p>

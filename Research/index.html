    <h1> Current Research </h1>
    <p> My work combines both observational and theoretical based approaches via spectral energy distributions and atmospheric retrievals to understand the complex atmospheres of substellar sources. Presently, I am using the <em>Brewster</em> code written by Dr. Ben Burningham to explore the atmopsheres of these sources. Below are some of my current projects using <em>Brewster</em>.

    <h1> Past Research </h1>
    
    <p> As part of my dissertation work at the CUNY Gradudate Center, I focused on determining fundamental parameters of brown dwarfs and low-mass stars. I worked with the <a href="http://www.bdnyc.org">BDNYC</a> Research group, where I was adivsed by <a href="https://jackiefaherty.com">Dr. Jackie Faherty</a> at the American Museum of Natural History and <a href="https://star.herts.ac.uk/~bb/">Dr. Ben Burningham</a> at the University of Hertfordshire.
   
    <h2>Determing Fundamental Parameters of Brown Dwarfs and low-mass stars via SED fitting</h2>
    <h3>Understanding subdwarfs via a case study of SDSS J125637.13-022452.4</h3>
    <p>In this work, I used distance-calibrated spectral energy distributions (SEDs) to compare the subdwarf SDSS J1256-0224 to objects of the same temperature and bolometric luminosity. In doing so we found that clouds help change the overall SED shape, while gravity and metallicity features dominate the varations seen in the NIR bands. We also compared SDSS J1256 to subdwarfs with parallaxes and found that tempertaure does not correlate linearly with spectral type.

    <h3>Is Trappist-1 a unique host star?</h3>
    <p>As Trappist-1 hosts seven rocky planets, with four in its habitable zone, we hope to understand how common this type of system is. Trappist-1 is currently thought to be an older object, with an age of ~7.6 Gyr, however it recieves and INT-G classification when using the Allers & Liu 2013 indices. This work compares Trappist-1 to a sample of objects of similar temperature, bolometric luminosity, or gravity classification in an effort to understand the age of this fascinating system.

    <h3>Testing the Refurbished Leuschner 30-inch Telescope and it exoplanet detection capabilites</h3>
    <p>For my master's thesis work at San Francisco State University, I worked with <a  href="http://www.physics.sfsu.edu/~cool/">Dr. Adrienne Cool</a> 
    on a project that was one part telecope testing and one part research. I spent half of my time testing the pointing, tracking, and
    focusing ablities of the then recently refurbished Lesuchner 30-inch Telescope, located outside of Lafayette, CA. 
    The other half of my time was spent on seeing if the Leuschner telescope could be used to detect transiting exoplanets. 
    We in fact were able to detect transits of a few bright known hot Jupiters. </p>
    
    <h3>Blazhko Effect in RR Lyrae Stars</h3>
    <p>For my undergraduate Senior thesis at Michigan State University, I worked with <a href="https://www.pa.msu.edu/profile/smith/">Dr. Horace Smith</a>
    on determining light curves and periods for three varible stars. The goals of the project were to look for the Blazhko effect 
    in the lightcurves of RR Lyrae stars and to build data for the relationship between the shape of the lightcurve and the 
    metallicity in the SLOAN filters.</p>
    
    <h1> Student's Research </h1>
    <h2>Current Students</h2>
    <p>Currently, I am woriking with Jasmine Ramirez, a senior at UConn, on incorprtating new alkali opacites into Brewster as a possible methid for including optical
     data into reteirvals-- which are currrently exculded due to the large impact the KI pressure broadening at 0.77 microns has on the pseudo-continuum shape.</p>
    
    <p>I am also woriking with Celia Toral, a Cornell undergraduate, on retrieving the widely-seperated WISE 2150 system.</p>
    
    <h2>SRMP Students</h2>
    <p>From 2017-2019, I have mentored six high school students through the Science Research Mentoring Program (<a href="http://www.srmp4life.com/">SRMP</a>)
    the American Museum of Natural History (AMNH). This program consits of a year-long internship for high school students to work
    with a researcher at the musuem on a project related to their work. Students also attend monthly advisories where they develop
    other skills to be sucessful in research and their future careers.</p>
   
    <h3>SRMP 2018-2019: Updating FUndamental Parameters Of Brown Dwwrfs with Gaia </h3>
    <p>This 2018-2019 group created updated SEDs for field objects in the Filipazzo et al. 2015 sample
    using new Gaia DR2 parallaxes and medium-resolution NIR spectra. With these updated SEDs, we they improved values for field 
    dwarf fundamental parameters. They also learned how to use the <a href="http://database.bdnyc.org/query">BDNYC Database</a>,
    a large database of brown dwarfs containing parallaxes, spectra, photometry, and more. Below is their final presentaion poster.</p>

    <h3>SRMP 2017-2018: Stellar Speeds for Not So Stellar Objects</h3>
    <p>They 2017-2018 group spent their time examing newly discovered brown dwarfs via a proper motion search. The group
    created proper motion diagrams and spectral typed a small sample of objects in order to understand why these objects may
    have been missed in previous studies. Below is their final symposium poster. </p>

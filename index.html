			I am Dr. Eileen Gonzales, a 51 Pegasi b Postdoctoral Fellow at Cornell University in the <a href="https://astro.cornell.edu/"> Department of Astronomy</a>. My research focuses on understanding the fundamental parameters and atmospheres of low-mass stars, brown dwarfs and directly-imaged exoplanets through observational and theoretical based techniques. I received my PhD at the City University of New York Graduate Center in New York City, where I worked in the Brown Dwarfs in New York City (<a href="http://www.bdnyc.org/">BDNYC</a>) research group. I am a former <a href="https://astrodatascience.org/"> LSSTC Data Science Fellow </a> and a former Research Mentor in the <a href="https://www.srmp4life.com">Science Research Mentoring Program (SRMP)</a> at the American Museum of Natural History. You can learn more about my current and past research <a href="/Research">here</a>.</p>
